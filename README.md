# Home Videos - Centralized Video Database
*Author: Julia Melchert*

This **PHP** application allows my family to browse, upload, and search for home videos that are hosted on YouTube. After uploading the videos to YouTube as unlisted, my 
family can add the links to this website with other information (title, date, tags, etc.). From there, the videos are organized in a visually-pleasing way and can be searched for based on 
title or tags.

My family has boxes full of old VHS tapes with precious memories, and while they're fun to watch, it's often not worth the hassle to get the outdated technology working. So, this felt like a modern and scalable solution!

The web app incorporates the following: 
* Utilizes software security practices by enforcing authorization and authentication through a login and varying user permissions
* Interacts with a **SQL** database that stores user and video information
* Uses **JQuery** to create a dynamic experience for users
* Incorporates **CSS** to intuitively resize content to fit all screen sizes comfortably
